# Specification Quality Checklist: Heads-up NLHE Poker MVP (Rust Server + Windows Desktop Client)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-06
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- Two checklist items remain incomplete due to implementation details that are constitution-mandated constraints (Rust backend, Windows desktop client). These are considered acceptable for this specification.
- All other quality criteria are satisfied.
